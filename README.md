This repo contains the final Capstone project for the Beats By Dre Consumer Insights & Data Analytics Externship. I applied various data analysis techniques to analyze & extract customer reviews, ultimately resulting in the creation of data driven insights regarding the performance of newly released Beats speakers.
The final project encapsulated multiple skills, such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization, Sentiment Analysis, & implementation of Google Gemini to generate recommendations based on consumer sentiment.
